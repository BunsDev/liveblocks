To use Liveblocks in React, you need to install our packages to your
project. We’ve already installed the packages in this guide, but this is how you’d do it
in your own project:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client @liveblocks/react
```

### Setting up a client

The first step in connecting to Liveblocks is creating a client which will be responsible for communicating with our back end. You can do this by importing [`createClient`][] from [`@liveblocks/client`][], and passing your public API key.

You can also set up Liveblocks on the server with your secret key, but we’ll come back to that in the authentication section.

Ordinarily, you’d find your API keys on the [dashboard](/dashboard/apikeys), but for this tutorial, we’ll let you borrow a temporary key.

```ts
// Create client
const client = createClient({
  publicApiKey: "{% LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY %}",
});
```

### Creating room context

The next step is using [`createRoomContext`][] to generate and export all the React features we’ll be using—the first of which will be `RoomProvider`.

```ts
// Create room context
export const { RoomProvider } = createRoomContext(client);
```

Add the two snippets of code to see Liveblocks connect!
