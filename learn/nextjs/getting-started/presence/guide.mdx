## A guide about presence

A component that just renders some static markup isn't very interesting. Let's add some data.

First, add a script tag to your component and declare a name variable:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then do this:

```tsx
export function Component() {
  return (
    <div>Hello world</div>
  );
}
```
