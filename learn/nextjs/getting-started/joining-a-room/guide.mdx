Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people can collaborate.
To create a multiplayer experience, multiple users must be connected to the same room.

### RoomProvider

Remember how we exported `RoomProvider` from `liveblocks.config.ts`? This is the component weâ€™ll be using to connect to a room.
Switch to `app.tsx`
