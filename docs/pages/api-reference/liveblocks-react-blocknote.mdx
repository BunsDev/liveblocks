`@liveblocks/react-blocknote` provides you with a [React](https://react.dev/)
plugin that adds collaboration to any [BlockNote](https://www.blocknotejs.org/)
text editor. It also adds realtime cursors, document persistence on the cloud,
comments, and mentions. Use
[`@liveblocks/node-prosemirror`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node-prosemirror)
for server-side editing.

## Setup

To set up your collaborative Blocknote editor, grab an instance of the editor
with [`useCreateBlockNoteWithLiveblocks`](#useCreateBlockNoteWithLiveblocks) and
pass it into the `BlockNoteView` component provided by `@blocknote/mantine`.

```tsx
import { BlockNoteView } from "@blocknote/mantine";
import { useCreateBlockNoteWithLiveblocks } from "@liveblocks/react-blocknote";

function TextEditor() {
  // +++
  const editor = useCreateBlockNoteWithLiveblocks({}, { mentions: true });
  // +++

  return (
    <div>
      <BlockNoteView editor={editor} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
