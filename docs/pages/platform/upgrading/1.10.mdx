## How to upgrade? [#how]

You can upgrade to 1.10 by downloading the latest version of each Liveblocks
package you’re using, for example in a React app:

```bash
npm install @liveblocks/client@beta @liveblocks/react@beta @liveblocks/react-comments@beta @liveblocks/node@beta
```

If you’re using any other Liveblocks packages make sure to update those too.

Notifications are the first APIs that work across multiple rooms. It forces us
to introduce small breaking changes to

## `resolveUsers` and `resolveMentionSuggestions`

Notifications also need to resolve users and mentions, so we had to "lift" the
resolvers to `createClient`.

Before:

```tsx liveblocks.config.ts
// ❌ Before - Liveblocks 1.9
const client = createClient({
  /* ... */
});

const {} = createRoomContext({
  resolveUsers: () => {
    /* ... */
  },
  resolveMentionSuggestions: () => {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

After:

```tsx liveblocks.config.ts
// ✅ After - Liveblocks 1.10
const client = createClient({
  resolveUsers: () => {
    /* ... */
  },
  resolveMentionSuggestions: () => {
    /* ... */
  },
});

const {} = createRoomContext();
```

Additionally `resolveUsers` does not have a `roomId` argument anymore.

## `CommentBodyResolveUsersArgs`

The `CommentBodyResolveUsersArgs` type doesn't exist anymore, use
`ResolveUsersArgs` instead.

## `@liveblocks/react-comments`

Some advanced CSS variables have been removed: `--lb-elevation-*` and
`--lb-tooltip-*` no longer exist, instead use the basic variables on
`.lb-elevation` or `.lb-tooltip directly`. (e.g. instead of defining
`--lb-elevation-background` on `.lb-root`, define `--lb-background` on
`.lb-elevation`)

Some overrides have been updated and/or renamed: `SELF` is now `USER_SELF`,
`UNKNOWN_USER` is now `USER_UNKNOWN`, `COMMENT_REACTION_REMAINING` doesn't exist
anymore (use the general `LIST_REMAINING_USERS` instead), and
`COMMENT_REACTION_TOOLTIP` is now `COMMENT_REACTION_LIST` (with its arguments
ordered as `list`, `emoji`, and `count`).
