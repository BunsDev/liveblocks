We are introducing attachments to allow users to add files to their comments.

## How to upgrade? [#how]

You can upgrade to 2.8 by downloading the latest version of each Liveblocks
package you’re using. The easiest way to do that is to run the following
command:

```bash
npx create-liveblocks-app@latest --upgrade
```

## All changes are for Comments

If you are not using Comments or are not using
[the default Comments components](/docs/products/comments/default-components),
there are no breaking changes for you! However, if you are, or intend to use
them later, keep reading.

### Attachments

While technically not a breaking change, attachments are enabled by default in
the default components. If you want to disable them, you can do so by setting
the `showAttachments` prop to `false` on the relevant components you use
([`Composer`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Composer),
[`Comment`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Comment),
[`Thread`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Thread), and
[`InboxNotification`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#InboxNotification.Thread)).

### Default `Composer` component structure

The default [`Composer`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-ui#Composer)
component’s structure has slightly changed, so if you customized its styles:
make sure to check if and how the new structure affects your changes.

```html
<!-- ❌ 2.7 and earlier -->
<form class="lb-root lb-composer lb-composer-form">
  <!-- The editor and its controls -->
</form>

<!-- ✅ 2.8 -->
<form class="lb-root lb-composer lb-composer-form">
  <div class="lb-composer-editor-container">
    <!-- The editor and its controls -->
  </div>
</form>
```
