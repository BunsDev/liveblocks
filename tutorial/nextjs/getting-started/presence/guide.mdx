Most collaborative features rely on each user having their own temporary state, which is then shared with others.
For example, in an app using multiplayer cursors, the location of each user’s cursor will be their state. In Liveblocks, we call this _presence_.

We can use _presence_ to hold any object that we wish to share with others. An example would be the coordinates of a user’s cursor on screen:

```js
cursor: { x: 256, y: 367 }
```

### Setting up presence

To start using presence, let’s define a type for it in [liveblocks.config.ts][]. We’ll use the format above for displaying cursors, with the addition of `null` to represent an off-screen cursor.

```ts
// Presence type
type Presence = {
  cursor: { x: number; y: number } | null;
};
```

Next, pass `Presence` to `createRoomContext` as a generic, and export the `usePresence` hook.

With our React package, you only need to handle your types once inside `liveblocks.config.ts`,
as they’ll automatically propagate through your entire app.

```ts highlight="4,5"
export const {
  RoomProvider,
  useOthers,
  usePresence, // ✅
} = createRoomContext<Presence>(client);
```

The last step in setting up presence is setting an initial value.
Switch to [App.tsx][] and pass `cursor: null` to [`RoomProvider`][]—no one starts with their cursor on-screen.

```tsx
<RoomProvider id={roomId} initialPresence={{ cursor: null }}>
```

Great job! On the next page we’ll be creating live cursors.
