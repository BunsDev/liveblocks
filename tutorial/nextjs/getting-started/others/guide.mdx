Now that we’re connected to a room, we can start using the Liveblocks hooks. The first we’ll add is [`useOthers`][], a hook that provides information about which _other_ users are connected to the room.

### Setting up hooks

The first step in using a Liveblocks hook is to export it from [liveblocks.config.ts][].

```ts highlight="3"
export const {
  RoomProvider,
  useOthers,
} = createRoomContext(client);
```

Then switch to [Room.tsx][] and import the hook—we’ll be building our real-time app in here.
```ts highlight="3"
import { useOthers } from "./liveblocks.config.ts";
```

### useOthers

The [`useOthers`][] hook returns a list of users that are currently online, along with their data. We can access `.length` to return the current online user count.

```tsx
const others = useOthers();
const userCount = others.length;
```

Add this to [Room.tsx][] to see the beginnings of an online app!
