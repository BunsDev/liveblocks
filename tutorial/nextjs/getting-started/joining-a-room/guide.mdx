Liveblocks uses the concept of rooms, separate virtual spaces where people can collaborate.
To create a real-time experience, multiple users must be connected to the same room.

### RoomProvider

Remember how we exported [`RoomProvider`][] from [liveblocks.config.ts][]? This is the component we’ll be using to connect to a room,
and it also enables us to use the Liveblocks React hooks. `RoomProvider` has two required properties:
 
 1. `id` - The unique name of the room, a string.
 2. `initialPresence` - We'll learn about this on the next page.
 
Switch to [App.tsx][] and return a `RoomProvider` component with the `roomId` string, and an empty object as the `initialPresence`.

```tsx
<RoomProvider id={roomId} initialPresence={{}}>
  <Room />
</RoomProvider>
```

We’ll be building our custom real-time app inside [Room.tsx][], so we’re adding this component as a child.
