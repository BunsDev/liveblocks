Welcome to the Liveblocks interactive tutorial! In this guide you’ll be learning how to get started
with the Liveblocks [React](https://react.dev/) package, and further, how to build your collaborative app with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

### What is Liveblocks?

Liveblocks is a complete toolkit for embedding performant collaboration features into your app. [more text]

### How to use this tutorial

<Banner title="Prerequisites">

This guide assumes you’re comfortable with React and have basic knowledge of Next.js and TypeScript.

Each page of this tutorial has been designed to highlight a different Liveblocks feature. Read the instructions in the
text panel, then follow along be editing the code in the live editor. The results of your code are then displayed
in the two preview windows.

If you get stuck, you can press the "Show solution" button to see the correct result, but don’t rely on it—you’ll learn
 more quickly by figuring the solution out for yourself.
 
### Ready to begin?
Add the following code snippet to [App.ts](#/App.ts) in the editor:

```ts
export const ready = true;
```

Then press the button for the next page, "Connecting to Liveblocks".
