Liveblocks allows your to embed a notification settings configuration experience
in your application. This guide will show you how to configure notification
settings.

## What we're building

In this guide we'll be learning how to configure notification settings at the
project level in the dashboard and how to implement a notification settings
configuration page in your application.

## What are inbox notifications?

"add section here to explain the relation between inbox notifications and
notification settings in the dashboard and in an application."

## Using webhooks

Liveblocks provides a number of [webhooks](/docs/platform/webhooks) that can
send requests to your API endpoint when certain events occurs. One webhook we
provide is the [`NotificationEvent`](/docs/platform/webhooks#NotificationEvent)
webhook.

## Create an endpoint in your project

When a webhook event is triggered, it can send a POST request to the back end in
your project. In this guide, we’ll be using a Next.js route handler (API
endpoint) as an example, but other frameworks work similarly.

In order to use webhooks, we’ll need to retrieve the `headers` and `body` from
the request. Here’s the basic endpoint we’ll be starting from:

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Handle webhooks and notifications
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

Create this endpoint in your project, and make it available on `localhost` at
the following URL:

```
/api/liveblocks-notifications
```

Make a note of this endpoint URL, as you’ll be using it later.

### Testing webhooks locally

Running webhooks locally can be difficult, but one way to do this is to use a
tool such as [`localtunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel) or
[`ngrok`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) which allow you to temporarily
put your localhost server online.

If your project is running on `localhost:3000`, you can run the following
command to generate a temporary URL that’s available while your localhost server
is running:

```bash
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```

`localtunnel` generates a base URL that can be placed into the Liveblocks
webhooks dashboard for quick testing. To use this, take the full address of your
webhook endpoint, and replace the domain in your `localhost` address with the
generated URL.

```shell
# Take your local URL
http://localhost:3000/api/liveblocks-notifications

# Replace localhost with the generated domain, then copy it
https://my-localtunnel-url.loca.lt/api/liveblocks-notifications
```

You now have a URL that can be used in the webhooks dashboard.

## Set up webhooks on the Liveblocks dashboard

To use webhooks, you need to pass your endpoint URL to the webhooks dashboard
inside your Liveblocks project, and tell the webhook to trigger when a comment
has been created.

## Verify the webhook request

The [`@liveblocks/node`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node) package provides
you with a function that verifies whether the current request is a real webhook
request from Liveblocks. You can set this up by setting up a
[`WebhookHandler`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#WebhookHandler) and
running [`verifyRequest`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#verifyRequest).

Make sure to add your “Webhook secret key” from the Liveblocks dashboard—in a
real project we’d recommend using an environment variable for this.

```ts highlight="1,3-5,11-21"
import { WebhookHandler } from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // Send notifications
  // ...

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

## Check the event and notification permissions

After verifying the request, we can then check we’re receiving the correct type
of event. There are different `notification` events, and in this case we’d like
to check for
[text mention notification](/docs/platform/webhooks#TextMention-notification),
as we’re specifically listening for new text mentions. We can do this using
[`isTextMentionNotificationEvent`](/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#isTextMentionNotificationEvent).

```ts
import {
  WebhookHandler,
  isTextMentionNotificationEvent,
} from "@liveblocks/node";

// Add your webhook secret key from a project's webhooks dashboard
const WEBHOOK_SECRET = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_KEY";
const webhookHandler = new WebhookHandler(WEBHOOK_SECRET);

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json();
  const headers = request.headers;

  // Verify if this is a real webhook request
  let event;
  try {
    event = webhookHandler.verifyRequest({
      headers: headers,
      rawBody: JSON.stringify(body),
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return new Response("Could not verify webhook call", { status: 400 });
  }

  // +++
  // When an inbox notification has been created
  if (isTextMentionNotificationEvent(event)) {
    // Check if user has access to room
    if (!__hasRoomAccess__(event.userId, event.roomId)) {
      return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
    }

    // The user to send the email to
    const emailAddress = __getEmailAddressFromDB__(event.userId);

    // Send notifications
    // ...
  }
  // +++

  return new Response(null, { status: 200 });
}
```

Note that we’re also checking if the user should receive a notification, and
getting their email address—Liveblocks doesn’t have knowledge of your
permissions system on the back end, so it’s your responsibility to check if this
user should have access to the room.
